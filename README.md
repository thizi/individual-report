# Local voice agent: security and autonomy of AI agents

A voice agent prototype that runs locally, without internet, plus a literature review on the security of AI agents (PhD work in progress).

## Context

AI agents can act (read files, use tools), which creates new security risks. This project combines reading research papers with building a prototype to study these risks concretely.

## Literature review

| Paper | Goal |
|---|---|
| **From Threat to Trust** | A method to assess the risks of an AI agent, layer by layer |
| **ART** (*Security Challenges in AI Agent Deployment* competition) | Measure whether agents follow their rules under attack: 1.8 million attacks against 22 agents, and almost all of them broke their rules within 10 to 100 attempts |
| **AgentDojo** | A test environment to measure how well agents resist *prompt injections* |
| **Large Multimodal Agents: A Survey** (in progress) | State of the art on multimodal agents, described through 4 components: perception, planning, action, memory |

## The prototype

### How it works

```text
Audio / microphone -> Faster-Whisper -> text -> Ollama + Qwen3:8b -> _analyse.txt file
```

1. The input is an audio file or the microphone.
2. **Faster-Whisper** transcribes the speech into text.
3. **Qwen3:8b**, run by **Ollama**, analyzes the text.
4. The result (transcription and analysis) is written to a `.txt` file.

### Components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| Python 3.14.7 + `.venv` | Programming language and isolated environment |
| `agent_vocal.py` | Script that coordinates the steps |
| Faster-Whisper (`small`) | Speech recognition |
| Ollama | Runs the language model locally |
| Qwen3:8b | Analyzes the transcribed text |
| `.wav` / `.txt` files | Recorded sound / transcription and analysis |

### Running the program

```powershell
cd C:\Users\thizi\agent-vocal
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\agent_vocal.py
```

> We call the `.venv` `python.exe` directly because `Activate.ps1` is blocked by PowerShell's execution policy.

## Tests completed

- [x] Qwen3:8b answers in the terminal
- [x] Python communicates with Ollama ("Connexion réussie")
- [x] The microphone produces a `.wav` file
- [x] Transcription and analysis produce an `_analyse.txt` file
- [x] Full test with Wi-Fi turned off

## Limitations

- Fixed-step prototype, not an autonomous agent.
- Qwen receives the transcribed text, not the sound.
   - No Voice tone analysis.


## Common thread

The survey describes the components of an agent, *From Threat to Trust* helps assess their risks, ART and AgentDojo measure them, and the prototype serves as a small concrete testbed.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Finish the *Large Multimodal Agents* survey and write a summary sheet (goal, main idea, limitations, link to the prototype)
- [ ] Make the prototype more autonomous: Qwen chooses its own tools (smolagents, LangChain, or Ollama tool calling)
- [ ] Add emotion and voice tone analysis: librosa, openSMILE, wav2vec2 model
